								In 2017 Grey Warwick of Warwick Esports won the NUEL championship against the Aston Yellowtails carrying them through to the

								They walked away after unfortunately losing in the finals.
								<br>
								In 2018 we reached the Quarter Finals of the Forge of Champions open qualifiers, meaning we progressed to play against semi-pro UK teams!

								The Warwick Strethyboiz were 2018 NUEL championship winners, meaning they were able to attend ECS with a VIP pass, meeting players and the organisers of the event.
								A link to the video can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUtWMa_rt9g">here</a>.<br>
								The Warwick Stretchyboiz also beat the Lancaster Bombers to place first in <a href="https://uomesports.co.uk/">King of the North 2018</a>, meaning they are currently the best university team in the UK.
								The CS:GO community is also particular active, partcipating regularly in hub events and competitive tournaments. Again, all skill levels welcome!

								Here at Warwick we have a very active and open Overwatch community brought together by the fundamental element of the game: teamwork. 
								We regularly host PUGS (pick up games) where anyone can join and play some competitive games with each other, regardless of ability or experience, all with the aim of improving and having fun. 
								The Warwick Angels team is the best Overwatch team the University can put out and we regularly place high up in the NUEL tournaments each term. 
								In this team we aim to push each other forward to improve both collectively and individually and we were recently invited to a NSE invitational tournament in London in which we performed extremely well against experienced opposition and came away with a solid win. 
								We welcome everyone to our sociable and inclusive community and an invite to our Discord server can be found above.

								The Warwick Castles have competed in all seasons of the <a href="https://twitter.com/usl_r6?lang=en">University Siege League</a> and were one of the founding teams; finishing second in the first season. 
								Being a founding member has let us have our voice heard when asked and has helped mould the league – pushing it forward to the competitive environment it is. 
								We play ranked regularly, often mixing the university teams with our outside groups to let us play with constant comms to maximise our win chances. 
								A wide mix of players lets strategies be easily shared and the preferred playstyles means no one is forced into positions they don’t enjoy. 
								Come join us on our discord server (link above) for more information.

The society’s Smash Wednesdays events support both casual and competitive play, 
								with friendly tournaments at the Uni almost every week. We cover all Smash Bros. games, though mainly Melee and Smash4. Our players often also attend external tournaments (with varying success), 
								but looking forward to making a name for ourselves in Smash Ultimate!
